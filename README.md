# Genre_Classifier
Genre classification using Tensorflow with Keras

See part 5 to see the neural net architecture and training and part 6 for discussion of the results.

## Music Prediction
To run the Music predictor you can choose to download a youtube song via 'music_downloader.ipynb' and then run 'music_predictor.ipynb'. I have separated the files due to packaging conflict but you can use your own songs as well if you like. You must have "streaming_music_extractor" from AcousticBrainz in order to extract the spectral data from the mp3 file.
